HighVolumeAutomationTesting
===========================

High Volume Automation Testing (H-VAT) is a technique that generates many (potentially weak) tests in hopes of finding bugs that standard testing failed to find. It's common for such a technique to generate massive amounts of tests in hopes of finding certain bugs. This implementation attempts to gauge the correctness of audio conversions.
